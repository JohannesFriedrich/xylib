This is a version of xylib integrated with fityk.
Original (older) version of xylib see is here: http://www.sf.net/projects/xylib


PURPOSE
=======
xylib is a library for reading files that contain x-y data from powder 
diffraction, spectroscopy or other experimental methods.


SUPPORTED FORMATS
=================
plain text (CSV or TSV or space-separated-values)

Crystallographic Information File for Powder Diffraction (pdCIF)
Siemens/Bruker UXD
Siemens/Bruker Diffrac-AT RAW v1/2/3
Philips UDF 
Philips RD (raw scan) V3
Rigaku DAT 
Sietronics Sieray CPI 
DBWS/DMPLOT data file
Canberra MCA (one of formats)
XFIT/Koalariet XDD 
RIET7/LHPM/CSRIET/ILL_D1A5/PSI_DMC DAT

Vamas ISO14976
    only experiment modes: "SEM" or "MAPSV" or "MAPSVDP" are supported
    only "REGULAR" scan_mode is supported
Princeton Instruments WinSpec SPE 
    only 1-D data is supported

FILES
=====
xylib/
    xylib.h 
    xylib.cpp 
    	xylib functions and main classes.
    
    util.h
    util.cpp
    	Internal-used helper functions in namespace xylib::util.
    		
    Other .cpp/.h files correspond to supported file formats.
    Each of these .cpp files contains basic info about the format
    in constructor of struct FormatInfo. Each header files includes a note 
    what the implementation is based on (i.e. what documentation was available
    to a developer). In some cases a format is described in .cpp file (above
    load_data() method).

	
xyconv.cpp
    A user tool with arguments to convert xylib-supported file to ASCII file.
	
samples/
    run get_samples.sh to download sample files

samples.sh
     Shell script that converts all of the sample files in ./sample 
     to ASCII plain format in ./output

	
USAGE
=====
See xylib/xylib.h for library API
xyconv is a simple converting program and an example how to use the library

THANKS 
======
(from original xylib)
First of all, I'd like to thank my mentor Marcin Wojdyr for his careful and in-time mentoring during the whole project process. He spent lots of time to review my code and gave me many good suggestions about the library design and implementation.
I'd like to thank Google for hosting the GSoC project to promote the Open Source Software in the globe. 
Thanks to Michael Richardson <michael.richardson@vuw.ac.nz>, for his kind help to send us a specification of VAMAS format and some sample files, and suggestions for the JCAMP-DX paper download URL.
Thanks to David Hovis <dbh6@case.edu>, for sending us a WinSpec file format specification and the sample file.
Thanks to Pablo Bianucci <pbian@physics.utexas.edu>, for sending us a WinSpec implentation source code and an SPE sample file.
Thanks to Brian H. Toby <Brian.Toby@anl.gov>, for his useful info and suggestions about the pdCIF format.
Thanks to Martijn Fransen <martijn.fransen@panalytical.com>, for sending us a very useful specification on Philips raw formats.
And thanks to all people who have helped me and gave suggestions to the xylib project.
