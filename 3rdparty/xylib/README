OVERVIEW
========
xylib is a library for reading files that contain x-y data from powder 
diffraction, spectroscopy or other experimental methods.


Supported formats:

* plain text (CSV or TSV or space-separated-values)
* Crystallographic Information File for Powder Diffraction (pdCIF)
* Siemens/Bruker UXD
* Siemens/Bruker Diffrac-AT RAW v1/2/3
* Philips UDF 
* Philips RD (raw scan) V3
* Rigaku DAT 
* Sietronics Sieray CPI 
* DBWS/DMPLOT data file
* Canberra MCA (one of formats)
* XFIT/Koalariet XDD 
* RIET7/LHPM/CSRIET/ILL_D1A5/PSI_DMC DAT
* Vamas ISO14976
    only experiment modes: "SEM" or "MAPSV" or "MAPSVDP" are supported
    only "REGULAR" scan_mode is supported
* Princeton Instruments WinSpec SPE 
    only 1-D data is supported
 

For API description, see: xylib/xylib.h file.


NOTES
=====
This is a version of xylib integrated with fityk.
Original (older) version of xylib see is here: http://www.sf.net/projects/xylib

Filetype samples are not distributed with the library, but there is a script
samples/get_samples.sh that tries to download them from Internet.
See the script for more info.

The library includes a tiny program xyconv, which converts from any file 
supported by xylib to TSV.

xylib is used by fityk (since version 0.8.3).
	
	
HOW TO ADD A NEW FORMAT
=======================
Please contact us first, see: CONTACT 

Each .cpp/.h file pair in xylib/ (excluding xylib.* and util.*) corresponds
to one supported filetype.  Each of these .cpp files contains basic info 
about the format in constructor of struct FormatInfo. Each header files 
includes a note what the implementation is based on (i.e. what documentation 
was available to a developer). In some cases the format is described in .cpp 
file (above load_data() method).

To add a new filetype: 
* go to xylib/ subdirectory
* write new_format.cpp and .h files
* #include new_format.h file in xylib.cpp
* add an entry to formats[] array in xylib.cpp
* add new_format.cpp and .h files to Makefile.am

CREDITS
=======
* The library was started as Google Summer of Code 2007 project by Peng ZHANG,
mentored by Marcin Wojdyr from Fityk organization.

* Michael Richardson <michael.richardson@vuw.ac.nz> provided VAMAS 
  specification and sample files.
* David Hovis <dbh6@case.edu> provided a WinSpec file format specification 
  and sample files.
* Pablo Bianucci <pbian@physics.utexas.edu> provided his code for reading 
  WinSpec format and sample files.
* Brian H. Toby <Brian.Toby@anl.gov> suggested adding pdCIF format.
* Martijn Fransen <martijn.fransen@panalytical.com> provided very useful 
  specifications of Philips formats.
* Vincent Favre-Nicolin provided PSI_DMC and ILL_D1A5 samples; reading his
  ObjCryst library was also helpful.
