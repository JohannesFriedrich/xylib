HOW TO ADD A NEW FORMAT
=======================

Each .cpp/.h file pair in xylib/ (excluding xylib.*, cache.* and util.*)
corresponds to one supported filetype.

To add new filetype foo:

-  go to xylib/ subdirectory
-  write foo.cpp and foo.h files (or copy and modify existing files) 
-  in foo.h write what your implementation is based on,
   i.e., what documentation is available to you.
-  #include foo.h in xylib.cpp
-  add an entry to formats[] array in xylib.cpp (but not after TextDataSet)
-  add foo.cpp and foo.h files to xylib/Makefile.am

Do not worry too much about metadata. In case of binary formats xylib/xyconv
may be useful to just read the metadata, but if the original file is
human-readable metadata matters only if programs that use xylib can take
advantage of it.

You may contact us before you start, to avoid duplication of work.
