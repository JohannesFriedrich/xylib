HOW TO ADD A NEW FORMAT
=======================

Each .cpp/.h file pair in xylib/ (excluding xylib.*, cache.* and util.*)
corresponds to one supported filetype.

Each of these .cpp files contains basic info about the format
in constructor of struct FormatInfo. Each header file includes
a note what the implementation is based on (i.e. what documentation
was available to developers). In some cases the format is described
in .cpp file.

To add a new filetype:

-  go to xylib/ subdirectory
-  write new_format.cpp and .h files
-  #include new_format.h in xylib.cpp
-  add an entry to formats[] array in xylib.cpp
-  add new_format.cpp and .h files to xylib/Makefile.am
