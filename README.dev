HOW TO ADD A NEW FORMAT
=======================

Each .cpp/.h file pair in xylib/ (excluding xylib.*, cache.* and util.*)
corresponds to one supported filetype.

To add new filetype foo:

-  go to xylib/ subdirectory
-  write foo.cpp and foo.h files (or copy and modify existing files) 
-  in foo.h write what your implementation is based on,
   i.e., what documentation is available to you.
-  #include foo.h in xylib.cpp
-  add an entry to formats[] array in xylib.cpp (but not after TextDataSet)
-  add foo.cpp and foo.h files to xylib/Makefile.am
-  add xylib/foo.cpp to CMakeLists.txt

Do not worry too much about metadata, especially if the file is human-readable.
Currently programs that use xylib mostly ignore metadata.

You may contact us before you start, to avoid duplication of work.


METADATA CONVENTIONS
====================

Naming conventions are introduced and documented here when programs using
this library start relying on it.
