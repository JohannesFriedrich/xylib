PURPOSE
============
xylib aims to be a common X-Y data format reading library by providing a set of unified and user-friendly APIs to accomplish such a task. Many point data processing applications will be able to use this library to get a wider range of data file format support.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
============
X-Y plain text format: .txt, .asc
Siemens/Bruker uxd v1: .uxd
Diffrac-AT raw v2, v3: .raw

FILES
============
xylib.h 
xylib.cpp 
	Implementation of the xylib functions and classes.
	
testmain.h
testmain.cpp
	A simple test program to test the lib. Tested sample files are located in the directory ./test
	
test/
	Directory containing the original sample files. They are categorized into different sub-directories according to their types. For more detailed info (like where they are from), see the README file in each sub-directory.
	
out/
	Directory containing the exported X-Y plain text files. They are organized as the same way as files in test/. For example, "test/uxd/sample3.uxd" will be exported to "out/uxd/sample3.uxd_tr.txt".

	
USAGE
============
To run the test program, just change current directory to here and "make", "./testmain" is the executable.
To use xylib in your program, see how "testmain.cpp" and "testmain.h" do. Note that all classes, variables, functions are in the namespace "xylib".
