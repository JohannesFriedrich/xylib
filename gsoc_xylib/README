PURPOSE
============
xylib is one of the projects in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2007 (see http://code.google.com/soc), assigned to fityk organization (http://www.unipress.waw.pl/fityk/). 
xylib aims to be a common X-Y data format reading library by providing a set of unified and user-friendly APIs to accomplish such a task. Many point data processing applications will be able to use this library to get a wider range of data file format support.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
============
This is only a short list of all supported formats. For more info about the format, see "FORMAT DESCRIPTION" section in ds_XXX.cpp files.

X-Y plain text format:  										.txt, .asc, .dat, .csv
Siemens/Bruker uxd:     										.uxd
Diffrac-AT raw v1/2/3:  										.raw
Philips UDF Format:     										.udf
Rigaku Dat Format:      										.dat
Vamas ISO14976:         										.vms	(The experiment mode must not be "SEM" or "MAPSV" or "MAPSVDP", and so far only "REGULAR" scan_mode can be used to get X-Y data, "IREGULAR" and "MAPPING" scan_mode are supported to read in meta-info)
Princeton Instruments WinSpec SPE Format:						.spe 	(ONLY support 1-D)
Crystallographic Information File for Powder Diffraction:		.cif


FILES
============
xylib.h 
xylib.cpp 
	xylib functions and main classes.

util.h
util.cpp
	Internal-used helper functions in namespace xylib::util.
		
ds_*.h
ds_*.cpp
	Derived classes from DataSet, for reading meta-data and xy-data from specified file format.
	
xyconv.cpp
	A user tool with arguments to convert xylib-supported file to ascii file.
	
samples/
	Original sample files categorized into different sub-directories according to their types.

samples.sh
	Shell script to test all sample files in ./samples, output to ./output.

COMPILE
============
	Change current working directory to this position, then type
gmake clean && gmake
	
USAGE
============
To run the test program xyconv, type "xyconv" for usage and all supported options; type "xyconv -l" to list all supported formats.
To use xylib in your program, see xylib.h for the public interface, and xyconv.cpp to find out how to use it.

If you find any bugs or problems, please feel free to send mail to the authors, or the fityk devel ML (fityk-devel[a]lists[d]sourceforge[d]net).

THANKS
============
First of all, I'd like to thank my mentor Marcin Wojdyr for his careful and in-time mentoring during the whole project process. He spent lots of time to review my code and gave me many good suggestions about the library design and implementation.
I'd like to thank Google for hosting the GSoC project to promote the Open Source Software in the globe. 
Thanks to Michael Richardson <michael.richardson@vuw.ac.nz>, for his kind help to send us a specification of VAMAS format and some sample files, suggestion for the JCAMP-DX paper download URL.
Thanks to David Hovis <dbh6@case.edu>, for sending us a WinSpec file format specification and the sample file.
Thanks to Pablo Bianucci <pbian@physics.utexas.edu>, for sending us a WinSpec implentation source code and an SPE sample file.
Thanks to Brian H. Toby <Brian.Toby@anl.gov>, for his useful info and suggestions about the pdCIF format.
And thanks to all people who have helped me and gave suggestions to the xylib project.
