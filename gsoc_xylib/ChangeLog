* Added the docs/ directory to contain referenceable docs. "formats.txt" is a doc describing formats and other informatino about the completed formats.
* Added file format support: "Rigaku dat file". Tried to use Boost::regex to handle this text-based data file. Although this is not necessary in this case, maybe it will simplify the code in my opinion.
* Added the "file_type" strings to usage function

3:37 2007-6-21 GMT+8 version 309
* Added file format support: "vamas-iso14976 file". However, the MAPPING mode file (which is a 2-ary function, (x,y)->z) is not handled. 
* To simplify the code, add several helper functions. e.g. read_line_int()
