* SAMPLE SOURCE
=======================
QTZQUIN.RAW, 
CORKLZ20.RAW
are taken from WinFit sample file.

The two ".asc" files are corresponding plain text file translated by WinFit. They are the same as the files exported by xylib.

=======================
* IMPLEMENTATION REF
=======================
The implementation of this format is mainly based on the file format specification: some  pages of a scanned book sent me by Marcin Wojdyr (wojdyr@gmail.com). The title of these pages are "Appendix B: DIFFRAC-AT Raw Data File Format". 
In these pages, there are some tables listing every field of the DIFFRAC-AT v1 and v2/v3 formats; and at the end, a sample FORTRAN program is given.
