* SAMPLE SOURCE
=======================
	ALUMINA.cif	
	NISI.cif	
The two sample files are got from the sample directory of ciftools_Linux, an open-source CIF software package. You can download it from 
http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/programs/crystallography/software/cif/ciftools.html
The short descriptions of the 2 files in the "ciftools_Linux/samples/whatswhat.txt" in the package are as follows:
ALUMINA.cif	A 1-phase & 1-dataset pdCIF - CW neutron Rietveld fit (single block)
NISI.cif	A two-phase, two-dataset pdCIF - TOF Rietveld fit (6 blocks)
There are 2 additional ".cif" files in the package, but they do not contain Powder Diffraction data that we need. 

	ic0111177.cif
	ic034984fsi20030819_115442.cif
	1829.cif
	148L.cif
These 3 files are downloaded by googling "_pd_meas_intensity_total filetype:cif".
NOTE: ic034984fsi20030819_115442.cif and 1829.cif are valid pdCIF files without any Powder Diffraction data, so they can not be used to get x-y points, but can be uesed to get the meta-info.
148L.cif is not a pdCIF format.
