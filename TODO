TO BE CHANGED
=============
* handle CR as a newline (and perhaps also others from 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)
* is Rigaku RIG just another common extension for rigaku_dat? If yes, add it.
* text format: handle other numeric formats (e.g. ',' as a decimal separator)
* (?) support URIs (using libcurl, libfetch or boost:asio)


FORMATS TO BE ADDED
===================
* CHIPLOT format:
  http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/FIT2D/FIT2D_REF/node115.html
* Certified Scientific Software's spec format:
  http://www.certif.com/spec.html
  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6271
* PANalytical XRDML
* JCAMP format (Standard NMR Data Format)
* GSAS format (see gsas.cpp for comments) 
* CSV format (separate from text format).
  Should handle quoted strings properly.
  Can be based on boost.tokenizer:

  Non-numeric fields should be read as NaNs. Options: first-line-header.
