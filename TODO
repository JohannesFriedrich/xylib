REQUESTED FORMATS
=================

* Certified Scientific Software's spec format:
  http://www.certif.com/spec.html http://www.certif.com/goodies.html
  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6271
* PANalytical XRDML
* JCAMP format (Standard NMR Data Format)
* GSAS format (see gsas.cpp for comments) 
* Thermo GRAMS/32 SPC
* Rigaku raw file from Miniflex2 XRD. Low priority - Rigaku devs refused to
  show a spec ("The MiniFlex *.raw is Rigaku proprietary binary file format")

note: These formats wait for volunteers. Or at least for a code that
      could be adapted and included in this library.
